# export/README.md

This folder holds the outputs generated by the forecasting run: the full ledger of balances and an interactive HTML chart.

## Files

- `ledger_<timestamp>.csv`  
  A CSV snapshot of your combined historical and forecasted balances.  
- `forecast_<timestamp>.html`  
  A standalone Plotly HTML file visualizing bucket balances over time.

Timestamps use the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` to prevent name collisions.

---

## Generating Exports

Control export behavior in `src/app.py`:

- `SAVE_LEDGER` (boolean)  
  When `True`, writes the ledger CSV to this folder after simulation.  
- `SAVE_CHART` (boolean)  
  When `True`, writes the HTML chart here.

Tweak these flags, then run:

```bash
python src/app.py
```

---

## Viewing Outputs

- **CSV ledger**  
  Open in Excel, Google Sheets, or any data tool to analyze month-by-month bucket balances.  
- **HTML chart**  
  Open in your browser to explore interactive lines, hover tooltips, and zoom.

---

## Customization

- To change file names or paths, adjust the export logic in `src/app.py` under sections 8 (chart) and 9 (ledger).  
- You can modify the timestamp format or add subfolders (e.g., by year) to organize multiple runs.  

Keep this folder under version control to track output history, but consider adding large or sensitive exports to `.gitignore` if needed.
