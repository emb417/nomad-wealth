# export/README.md

This folder holds the outputs generated by your forecasting run: the consolidated ledger CSV and an interactive HTML chart.

---

## File Types

- **ledger\_[timestamp].csv**  
  A flat CSV of historical plus projected month-end balances for each bucket.
- **forecast\_[timestamp].html**  
  A standalone Plotly HTML file that visualizes bucket balances over time with interactive tooltips and zoom controls.

Timestamps use `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS` to avoid collisions across runs.

---

## Generating Exports

Control what gets written via flags in `src/app.py`:

- `SAVE_LEDGER` (boolean)  
  When `True`, writes the ledger CSV into this folder.
- `SAVE_CHART` (boolean)  
  When `True`, writes the HTML chart into this folder.

After toggling those flags, simply run:

```bash
python src/app.py
```

and check `export/` for fresh files.

---

## Viewing & Sharing

- Open the **CSV ledger** in Excel, Google Sheets, or your favorite data tool to slice, filter, and chart balances.
- Open the **HTML chart** in any modern browser to explore the forecast interactively.

Embed the HTML file in dashboards or share it directlyâ€”no server required.

---

## Customization

- To change output paths or filename patterns, edit the export section in `src/app.py`.
- Adjust the timestamp format or implement subfolders (e.g. by year or scenario) to organize multiple runs.
- Consider adding large exports or sensitive data files to `.gitignore` if you prefer not to version-control them.
