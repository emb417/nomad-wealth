### ðŸ§® Monte Carlo Net Worth Forecast

- **File:** `mc_networth_<timestamp>.html`
- **Description:** Interactive Plotly chart showing:
  - All simulation paths (light gray)
  - Median net worth trajectory (green)
  - 15th and 85th percentile bounds (blue dashed)
  - Probability of positive net worth at key ages:
    - 20 years before end date
    - 10 years before end date
    - Final year

### ðŸ“Š Sample Forecasts (per simulation)

These are only saved for simulations listed in `SIMS_SAMPLES`.

- **Files:**

  - `####_buckets_forecast_<timestamp>.csv` â€” Bucket balances over time
  - `####_taxes_forecast_<timestamp>.csv` â€” Tax breakdowns by year
  - `####_buckets_forecast_<timestamp>.html` â€” Interactive chart of bucket balances

- **Description:** For each sampled simulation:

  - Combines historical and forecasted data
  - Shows monthly bucket balances across all asset classes
  - Includes tax records and withdrawal snapshots

### ðŸ§¾ Notes

- All timestamps are formatted as `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` and reflect the moment the simulation was run.
- Net worth is computed as the sum of all bucket balances at each month.
- Age-based withdrawal logic (e.g. 59.5 years old) is applied to restrict access to tax-deferred assets.
- Roth conversions are modeled independently and may occur before age 59.5.

## Regeneration

To regenerate these files, run `main()` with appropriate flags:

- `SAVE_NETWORTH_CHART = True`
- `SAVE_SIMS_SAMPLES = True`
