# 🕊️ Nomad Wealth: Transparent Forecasting for Financial Freedom

Traditional financial models can be **opaque** and **unauditable**. Nomad Wealth is the Python framework built to solve this challenge. It provides a robust engine for **Monte Carlo simulations** that anchors every projection in **explicit, policy-driven** rules and **IRS-aligned** tax logic. The result is a **transparent and trustworthy** system that gives finance professionals and planners the confidence to **define, test, and execute** their path to financial freedom.
