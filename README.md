# Inflation Forecasting & Portfolio Projections

This Python framework offers a complete, policy-driven engine for Monte Carlo simulation of portfolio balances, cash flows, and tax liabilities. It ingests your historical balances and transactions to seed an auditable bucket model, then applies configurable refill rules, retirement-age gating, inflation-aware market returns, and tax calculations to project thousands of possible futures. Interactive charts and CSV exports turn these complex simulations into clear, actionable insights for smarter financial planning.

## Why This Framework Matters

### Move Beyond Simple Averages for True Financial Resilience

Traditional forecasting relies on single-point estimates or historical averages that gloss over real-world volatility and uncertainty. This framework embraces the inherent stochastic nature of markets and cash flows through Monte Carlo simulation, providing you with a full distribution of possible outcomes. You gain confidence in your plan's ability to withstand worst-case scenarios, not just the best or average.

### Financial Planning Driven by Your Rules, Not Only Assumptions

Its policy-first architecture is a game-changer. Instead of hardcoding generic rules, you explicitly define all critical financial decisions‚Äîfrom monthly cash-flow triggers and bucket refill strategies to withdrawal order and liquidation thresholds‚Äîin declarative JSON. This makes your plan fully transparent, repeatable, and adaptable as your life circumstances or tax laws change.

### Accurate Projections through Inflation and Tax Reality

By incorporating inflation-adjusted gain sampling and a sophisticated tax engine that models capital gains, income tax, and specific withdrawal penalties, the framework paints a far more realistic picture of future net worth and sustainable withdrawal rates. You get projections based on real purchasing power, avoiding the pitfalls of over-optimistic nominal returns.

### Gain Deep, Auditable Insight into Every Future Dollar

The core auditable, bucket-level transaction engine provides unparalleled transparency. You can trace every simulated dollar in and out of specific accounts (e.g., Taxable, Roth, 401k), offering a clear, scientific basis for optimizing asset location and withdrawal strategies. This moves your planning from a black box to a fully verifiable, strategic model.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emb417/nomad-wealth
   ```

   - use a virtual environment to install dependencies.
   - Or install dependencies manually:

   ```bash
   cd nomad-wealth
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure profiles and policies in `config/` (see `config/README.md`)
3. Supply historical balances and transactions in `data/` (see `data/README.md`)
4. Adjust flags in `src/app.py`:
   - `SIMS`, `SIMS_SAMPLES`
   - `SHOW_NETWORTH_CHART`, `SAVE_NETWORTH_CHART`
   - `SHOW_SIMS_SAMPLES`, `SAVE_SIMS_SAMPLES`
   - `SHOW_HISTORICAL_NW_CHART`, `SAVE_HISTORICAL_NW_CHART`
5. Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

## üß† Simulation Logic

Each month the engine sequentially applies:

1. Core transactions (fixed, recurring, rental, salary, SS, Roth)
2. Threshold-based refills (age-gated for tax-deferred sources)
3. Market returns via inflation-aware gain sampling
4. Emergency liquidation when cash falls below threshold, bypassing age-gating if needed (i.e. tax-penalized)
5. Monthly tax drip and tax collection
6. Balance snapshot and tax aggregation
7. January year-end tax payment and penalty integration
