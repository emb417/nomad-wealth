# 🕊️ Nomad Wealth Documentation

---

Welcome to **Nomad Wealth**, the Python framework for **transparent financial forecasting**. If you’ve ever used financial planning tools and felt like you couldn’t see the assumptions behind the numbers, you’re not alone. Many systems give you results but don’t show how they were calculated, leaving you guessing about what’s really driving the forecast.

Nomad Wealth is different. Every rule is explicit, every tax calculation is IRS‑aligned, and every simulation is reproducible. Instead of wondering what’s hidden, you can trace each dollar across buckets, policies, and scenarios. That means you don’t just get a projection — you get **clarity, confidence, and the ability to understand why the numbers look the way they do**.

Whether you’re **planning retirement, testing “what‑if” scenarios, or simply checking if you’re on track**, Nomad Wealth helps you **see clearly, adjust confidently, and trust the outcomes**.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

Nomad Wealth is built around:

- **Policy‑First** → Your plan follows clear, rule‑based logic.
- **Audit Clarity** → Every forecast is traceable, so you can trust the numbers.
- **IRS Alignment** → Tax rules and penalties are modeled exactly as they apply to you.
- **Resilience** → Monte Carlo simulations show how your plan holds up under uncertainty.
- **Transparency** → Charts and reports make it easy to see what’s happening.
- **Extensibility** → Advanced users can customize rules, but you don’t need to for core planning.
